= RxSWT - Reactive Programming in SWT

image:https://travis-ci.org/SimonScholz/RxSWT.svg?branch=master["Build Status", link="https://travis-ci.org/SimonScholz/RxSWT"] image:https://codecov.io/gh/SimonScholz/RxSWT/branch/master/graph/badge.svg["Code Coverage Status", link="https://codecov.io/gh/SimonScholz/RxSWT"]

RxSWT is based on http://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava[RxJava 2] and provides a custom scheduler for synchronizing with the SWT UI thread.

The coding is adapted from https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid[RxAndroid], since Android also has a main thread, which needs to be synchronized with the UI like SWT.

== Binaries

The binaries are available on Bintray: https://dl.bintray.com/simon-scholz/RxJava-Extensions/

=== Gradle

[source, groovy]
----
repositories {
	jcenter()
	maven {
		url 'https://dl.bintray.com/simon-scholz/RxJava-Extensions/'
	}
}

dependencies {
	compile 'io.reactivex.swt:rxswt:0.1.0'

	// other dependencies ...
}
----

=== Maven

[source, xml]

=== P2 Update Site

Since for Eclipse RCP development SWT is mainly used as UI toolkit it is likely that you'll want to obtain RxJava and RxSWT from a P2 update site.

A P2 update site is available here: https://dl.bintray.com/simon-scholz/RxJava-OSGi/

A sample project containing an Eclipse 4 sample application using RxJava and RxSWT can be found here: https://github.com/SimonScholz/rxjava-osgi[rxjava-osgi]

== Samples

A sample SWT application is part of this Git repository. See <<building>> to run the sample application.

But there is also a https://github.com/SimonScholz/rxjava-osgi[rxjava-osgi] repo, which contains the build for a p2 updatesite and a Sample Eclipse 4 application using http://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava[RxJava 2] and RxSWT.

Using the RxSWT `Scheduler` is fairly simple.

[source, java]
----
Observable.create(emitter -> {
 // ... do some heaving processing, which shouldn't be done on the main thread
}).subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
  .observeOn(SwtSchedulers.currentDisplayThread())
  .subscribe(System.out::println, Throwable::printStackTrace);
----

Besides using the current `Display`, the default `Display` or a user defined `Display` can be used:

[source, java]
----
Display display = new Display();
Observable.create(emitter -> {
  // ... do some heaving processing, which shouldn't be done on the main thread
}).subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
  .observeOn(SwtSchedulers.from(display))
  .subscribe(System.out::println, Throwable::printStackTrace);
----

== Working with the code

=== Getting the code from GitHub

The code can simply be cloned from GitHub by using the command line:

[source, console]
----
# Using HTTPS
$ git clone https://github.com/SimonScholz/RxSWT.git

# Using SSH
$ git clone git@github.com:SimonScholz/RxSWT.git
----

Or you can use your favorite Git tooling, e.g., EGit Eclipse Git integration.

[[building]]
=== Building

Unlike many other Eclipse related project Gradle is being used instead of Maven Tycho.

[source, console]
----
$ cd RxSWT
$ ./gradlew build
----

Besides just building the projects you can also directly run the sample application by using the `run` task:

[source, console]
----
$ cd RxSWT
$ ./gradlew run
----

=== Importing the code

In order to use and run the code in the Eclipse IDE you need to install the Buildship tooling by either using the https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.buildship/downloads[update site] or a https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/buildship-gradle-integration[market place] installation.

Buildship contributes a Gradle Import Wizard to the Eclipse Import Wizards, which can be used to import the RxSWT project.

Once the projects are imported you can play around, modify it or run the sample `App`.
